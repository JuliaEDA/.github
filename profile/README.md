## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to the Julia EDA organization! We're a group of passionate, engineers, researchers, and enthusiasts who are dedicated to developing open-source electronic design automation (EDA) tools using the power of the Julia programming language.

### What is Julia EDA all about?

Our mission is to provide the EDA community with high-quality, user-friendly tools for classical and quantum computers that can streamline the design, simulation, and verification of electronic circuits and systems. We believe that Julia's strong performance, ease of use, and growing ecosystem make it an ideal choice for building modern EDA tools.

### Current Projects
You can find our current projects and their documentation on the [JuliaEDA organization's GitHub page](https://github.com/JuliaEDA):

- [Gaiger](https://github.com/JuliaEDA/Gaiger): A circuit synthesizer and logic and LUT optimizer that parallelizes the Berkeley ABC tool using Julia's powerful parallel computing capabilities.
- [DynamicQuantumCircuits.jl](https://github.com/JuliaEDA/DynamicQuantumCircuits.jl): A package for optimizing and verifying quantum circuits, designed to overcome the limitations of current Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices by reducing the number of qubits or depth.

### How can the community get involved?

We welcome contributions from the community! Whether you're an experienced EDA engineer or a newcomer to the field, there are many ways you can get involved:

- **Report issues**: If you encounter any bugs or have feature requests, please open an issue in the relevant repository.
- **Submit pull requests**: We're always looking for contributors to help us improve our tools. Feel free to submit pull requests with bug fixes, new features, or documentation improvements.
- **Join the discussion**: Participate in our discussions on the project forums, mailing lists, or social media channels to share your ideas and collaborate with other members.
- **Spread the word**: Help us grow the Julia EDA community by sharing our work with your colleagues, friends, and on social media.
